## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Implementing destructuring and the spread operator together to get the top and second most funded game was a challenge
as it was my first time learning about them. I probably spent most of my time working on implementing them as I tried to
figure how to use both of them to get the desired results. The ternary operator was a bit tricky since I was used to the typical
if/else structure, but I got the hang of them now.
